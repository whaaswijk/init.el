#+TITLE: Emacs configuration

The idea of organizing my Emacs configuration was shamelessly stolen
from Harry Schwartz, see [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzA2YODtgK4][here]].

* MELPA Connection

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(let* ((no-ssl (and (memq system-type '(windows-nt ms-dos))
                    (not (gnutls-available-p))))
       (proto (if no-ssl "http" "https")))
  (when no-ssl
    (warn "\
Your version of Emacs does not support SSL connections,
which is unsafe because it allows man-in-the-middle attacks.
There are two things you can do about this warning:
1. Install an Emacs version that does support SSL and be safe.
2. Remove this warning from your init file so you won't see it again."))
  ;; Comment/uncomment these two lines to enable/disable MELPA and MELPA Stable as desired
  ;;(add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa" (concat proto "://melpa.org/packages/")) t)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives (cons "melpa-stable" (concat proto "://stable.melpa.org/packages/")) t)
  (when (< emacs-major-version 24)
    ;; For important compatibility libraries like cl-lib

* UI/UX customization

* Org-mode customization
  Show bullets instead of asterisks, and hide leading stars.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

Allow for easy access to agenda.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key global-map "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
#+END_SRC
